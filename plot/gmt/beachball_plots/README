These input files and scripts are designed for testing plotting routines for full moment tensors. 
Unless notes, the codes were tested with GMT 4.5.3
Testing with GMT 6.0.1 is ongoing (Nov 2019).

---

EXAMPLE 1:
csh -f lune_beachballs_min.csh
produces the ps file lune_ngeo_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_min.ps

Alternative scripts for different versions of GMT:
lune_gmt453dreger.csh --> lune_gmt453dreger.pdf
lune_gmt544.csh       --> lune_gmt544.pdf
lune_gmt600.csh       --> lune_gmt600.pdf
lune_gmt601.csh       --> lune_gmt601.pdf

---

For examples 2 and 3, you will need to have the full compearth repository available; or at least have the datafiles present in the directory at ../dfiles/

EXAMPLE 2:
lune_beachballs.pl        --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1.pdf
lune_beachballs_gmt601.pl --> lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt601.pdf


EXAMPLE 3:
uncomment lines 25 and 26 in lune_beachballs.pl, then run
produces the ps file lune_ngeo_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1.ps

In these figures, there are arcs plotted for directions of eigenvalue space where one of the eiganvalues of the moment tensor is zero: lambda3 = 0 (top), lambda2 = 0 (upper left to lower right), and lambda1 = 0 (bottom).

Status: As of 2019-11-14, GMT 6.0.1 seems to have a bug when plotting lamda2 = 0 full moment tensors.
See lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt601.pdf vs lune_hammer_iplot2_lplot1_kplot1_gmt601.pdf
The issue is in the sixth lune plot.

The error message is:
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 1, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 2, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 3, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 4, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 6, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 7, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 8, please report the issue to us! 
Warning: bigisotest failed for record 9, please report the issue to us!

Note that some of these moment tensors, although not double couples, do NOT have a big isotropic component.
