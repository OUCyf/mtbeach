system requirements:
Mathematica -- we have tested with 9.0 and 10.0

-----------

Lune.nb
  stand-alone starter script for points on the lune
  see Lune.pdf for example output

-----------
For more plotting features, run the following two notebooks (in order):
  common_funs.nb
  common_MTfuns.nb

Then try one of these:

LuneWithOptions.nb
  plotting points on the lune with fancier options

BBs3Dand2D.nb
  plotting moment tensors in 3D (and 2D)

BBsWithOptions.nb
  fancy views of moment tensors, including vector field flow lines

FaultBlockPicture.nb
  plotting a plane, along with a double couple beachball

BrickCode.nb
  fold-up box of strike-dip-rake -- insights for plotting misfit function for DC moment tensors
