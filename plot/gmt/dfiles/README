compearth/momenttensor/plot/gmt/dfiles/README

This directory contains published data sets of full moment tensors, as well as some reference files for making lune plots. These files may be useful even if you do not use the perl/GMT script lune.pl.

[1] lune points from published data sets

sourcetype_gdvw_xxxx.dat

gdvw = gamma delta v w
xxxx = tag associated with a published study

These files contain lune coordinates (lune longitude, lune latitude) for several published sets of moment tensors. Many of these were plotted in Tape and Tape, "The classical model for moment tensors" (GJI 2013).

These files were made by Carl Tape using a matlab script (FMTdata.m) to read the originally published tables and then convert them to lune coordinates and v-w coordinates.

Tape and Tape (2013) also included some published-but-not-tabulated data sets that are not provided here but were plotted or discussed in that paper; see the bibliography for details.
