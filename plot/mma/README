system requirements:
Mathematica -- we are using 9.0
If you are using 10.0, then there will be a problem with the function Subdivide, which we define ourselves, but Mathematica uses this name starting in 10.0. (Contact me if you have this issue.)

-----------

Lune.nb
  stand-alone starter script for points on the lune
  see Lune.pdf for example output

-----------
For more plotting features, run the following two notebooks (in order):
  common_funs.nb
  common_MTfuns.nb

Then try one of these:

LuneWithOptions.nb
  plotting points on the lune with fancier options

BBs3D.nb
  plotting moment tensors in 3D (and 2D)
